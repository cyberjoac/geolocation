geolocation
===========

Geolocation package in Python, based on API calls to KD-Tree (SciPy) and Geopy module (Google Maps)

See geolocation_test.py for usage.

This is my first contribution to open-source, I would be happy to have feedback on ways to improve.
I know this is not to the highest standards but I believe it's a good start.

It has heavy dependencies on external modules (scipy and geopy among others) so don't forget to install them.

Best
